### Here's how it works

1. [Login without any friction](https://carematey.com/api/auth/signin?callbackUrl=%2Fdashboard)
2. Create a space; your home, for example
3. Add your pet
4. Answer some questions about your pet
5. Do a little bit of refinement, add some more custom details
6. Click on the Share Space button, a link will be copied to your clipboard. Send it to whoever you need to

I recommend adding some other things besides pets. For example, the wifi password, if your sitter is staying overnight. Or maybe a schedule of the trash and recycling days.
