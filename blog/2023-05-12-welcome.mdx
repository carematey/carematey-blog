CareMatey was created for pet owners like myself to enable anyone to take care of our pets. When I leave home for a weekend and I need a last minute sitter I usually turn to some of my closest friends, or my parents, or even someone from a service like Rover.

We always made sure to meet whoever we planned to watch them in person to make sure they were legit, but more importantly they could build a bit of a rapport with our pets (an 11 year old German Shepherd Dog, a 3 year old Mini Pit mix, and a 5 year old Siamese cat). 

After that we did what most other pet parents have done which was to write some important details on paper, our "cheat sheat" so-to-speak, and leave it on the counter before leaving on a trip.

Hopefully, communication is between the sitter and us during the trip; pictures sent to us by our pet sitter, and daily updates on how things are going. Services that connect me with pet sitters do a great job of encouraging that. We didn't always use the services though, and sometimes we really weren't so lucky to get regular updates...

Sometimes, our cheat sheet would dissappear after a trip. Sometimes, the cheat sheet didn't get moved an inch. Both are a bit frustrating to see happen; did CJ get all his medicine while we were gone? 

Our best pet sitter was awesome, reliable, and couldn't make us happier. But they had several clients; how did they manage to keep track of all the directions from everyone else and MY pets?

So as a flowering web developer, I created a simple website that had all the instructions that my petsitters could need while my wife and I were away. 

I loved knowing that we didn't have to worry about if we forgot anything. The 'cheat sheet' isn't going to disappear before we get home, and if we are in an out-of-service area someone can find the answer they need on my site. 

But I was the only one that could edit it. If my wife wants to add something to the site, I'd have to make the code change and push the changes to the repo and check that they deployed to the domain I setup. 

Now years later, with some motiviation from my brother, now CoFounder, and CTO, CareMatey was created to help other trust that their sitter has everything they need.
